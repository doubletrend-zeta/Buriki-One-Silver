This file covers the states used in the Buriki One system. These states are listed there because they
are non-fluctuating. NEVER EVER give one of these states a number outside of it's designated range
because those ranges are hardcoded into both the Judges' Decision and Balance Gauge system. Without
these correct it won't line up with the system and it will be ignored in the system states.

Basic attacks = [200-499]
Throw = [800-899]
Special attacks = [1000-1999]
Super attacks = [3000-3999]
Grappling = [6000-6999]

Special State number groups that should never be used:

Judges' Decision = [-2]
Balance Gauge = [8000-8999]


Notes:
- The Special attack section is reserved for non-grappling special attacks. The grappling attacks have
their own section because the balance gauges changes into the grappling gauges when these states are
entered, and the grappling states directly affect the grappling gauges.
